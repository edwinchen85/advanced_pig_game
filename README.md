# ADVANCED PIG GAME

This is a continuation of [previous PIG GAME](http://edwinchen.co/easy_pig_game/) on which we will build an advanced version. Previous PIG GAME has a predefined score of 100. In this advanced PIG GAME, we allow user to set their TARGET score. We will roll 2 dices instead of 1 dice.

## GAME RULES:
- A player loses his entire score when he rolls two 6s in a row. After that, it will be next player's turn.
- There are 2 dices to roll. The player loses his current score when one of the dices is a 1.
